"""Audit of reach decisions — the policy engine's receipts, on the chain.

Ported in shape from `siyad01/agentbox` `internal/audit/logger.go`, vendored at
`D:/Users/china/Desktop/项目_开发/_vendor/agentbox`. What is taken from it:

  * one entry per decision, classified allow/deny *by dimension* rather than as
    a single boolean — `filesystem_deny` and `tool_deny` are different events
    because they are different problems
  * the fields a reader needs to re-judge the call without re-running it:
    `resource`, `rule`, `reason`, and a free `extra`
  * limit breaches logged next to policy denials, since "it was stopped" and "it
    was refused" are the two ways an agent loses reach and a reader should not
    have to look in two places
  * `alert_on`: a manifest can name the event types worth interrupting someone
    for

What is deliberately NOT taken
------------------------------
The Go version writes its own NDJSON file and does its own chaining. autoforge
already has a chain — `chaining.py`, with anchors, writer ids and `verify_chain`
— and 969 of its rows were already chained when this was written. A second
appender would be a second hash chain, and two chains is the same as none: the
question "was this log edited" would have two answers and no reason to prefer
either. So this module is a *vocabulary and a query layer* over the existing
ledger: every write goes through `chaining.append_event`, so audit rows land in
the same chain as every forge, run and amendment.

The one capability that was missing and is added here: the ledger recorded what
happened, but nothing answered "what was refused, and by which rule" — which is
the question the policy engine's receipts exist to make answerable.
