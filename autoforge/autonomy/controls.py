"""The control plane's receipts: every judgement the machinery makes, on the chain.

Why this exists
---------------
Three things in this package decide something and then forget they decided:

  * `tools/registry.py::_gate` — the operator was asked, and answered yes, no,
    or was not there. The outcome went to `ToolRegistry._events`, a list that
    lives in memory and dies with the process.
  * `forge/manifest.py::CapabilityManifest.admit` — a declaration was checked
    against the ceiling. Nothing has ever called it, so nothing has ever
    recorded that a declaration was judged.
  * `autonomy/selfmod.py::SelfModifier.amend` — a change to the agent was
    accepted, refused for want of a rationale, refused as a no-op, or vetoed.
    `amendments` is a list on an object that is rebuilt every session.

The ledger is the one durable record this project has. A decision that is real
enough to stop a tool from running is real enough to be a row in it — otherwise
"who allowed this, and what did they see" is answerable only from memory, and
memory is exactly what the next session does not have.

What this is not
----------------
It is not a second log. Every write goes through `audit.record`, which goes
through `chaining.append_event`, so these rows share the chain, the writer id
and `verify_chain` with every forge and run. A control plane with its own file
would be a second hash chain, and two chains is the same as none.

It is not a gate either. This observes; it never returns a verdict, and no
caller branches on it. A recorder that could refuse would need a policy, and
"the thing that decides" and "the thing that remembers what was decided" are
easier to trust when they are not the same object.

One plane instance per agent, held as `agent.controls`, and optional at every
call site: with no plane attached, `null_plane` swallows the receipt and the
behaviour is byte for byte what it was before. What it must never do is fail
*silently* — a control plane that cannot write says so, on the object, and in
`summary()`.
