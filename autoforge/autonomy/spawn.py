"""Spawning: the agent creates other agents, freely.

No pre-declared agent pool, no fixed orchestration graph. An agent decides at
runtime that a subtask wants its own worker, and spawns one. The child can
share the parent's tool registry (so tools forged by one are usable by all) or
get an isolated one (so experiments don't pollute the parent's library).

Two sharing modes:

  SHARED  — same registry object. A tool the child forges is immediately
            available to the parent. Fast convergence, but a bad tool
            propagates.
  ISOLATED — child gets a copy. It can forge freely; only tools that pass its
            verification AND the parent approves are merged back.

The parent chooses per-spawn. Default is SHARED, because the whole thesis is
that a growing shared library is the point — isolation is for when you want to
A/B a child's tool quality before trusting it.
