"""Hash-chained event log over the sqlite ledger.



The append-only event log recorded *what happened*. It could not answer a

different question: was any of it rewritten afterwards? Nothing in a row said

so, and 4535 rows were already on disk before anything could. This module adds

the field that makes each row self-witnessing.



Three columns are added to forge_events -- prev_hash, payload_hash, writer_id --

and nothing else about the table changes. Old code that still writes

`INSERT INTO forge_events (timestamp, kind, payload)` keeps working: those rows

land unchained and are reported as such, never silently trusted.



The region that already existed cannot be retroactively chained: the writer of

row 2000 was not recording prev_hash, and no amount of hashing now recovers

what it should have been. So the past is *anchored*, not chained. An anchor

freezes a digest of every legacy row as it stands at anchor time; if any legacy

row is edited later, that digest stops matching and verify() says so. The

distinction between "chained" and "anchored" is the whole point and is never

glossed: anchored rows are detectable-after-the-fact, chained rows are

detectable-individually.



Deliberately not a general log store: no query language, no compaction, no

pluggable backends. append, verify, anchor, lineage_of -- four verbs. Anything

resembling SQL belongs in the sqlite layer underneath.
