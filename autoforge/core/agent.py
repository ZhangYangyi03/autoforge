"""The agent loop.

Deliberately thin in mechanism, deliberately free in policy.

The three things that make this loop different from every other agent loop:

1. **No hidden turn cap.** `max_turns=None` (the default) means the agent runs
   until it produces a text answer or calls `terminate`. A cap exists only if
   the caller imposes one — and when one is imposed, it is logged, not silent.
   The agent decides when a task is done, not an arbitrary number baked into
   the framework.

2. **Self-termination is a first-class tool.** The agent can end its own turn
   loop, returning a summary and a reason. Combined with `unlimited_turns`,
   this means the stopping condition is *semantic* (the agent judges it's done)
   rather than *mechanical* (the counter hit N).

Everything else — tool dispatch, message threading — is ordinary, because that
part isn't what's broken in other frameworks.

3. **The context is compacted, never silently truncated.** An unbounded loop
   meets a bounded context window eventually, and the failure there is a
   provider error at the far end of the task. `compaction.py` replaces the
   middle of the history with a summary at a provably safe cut point. The loop
   itself only calls it; the policy — when, how much to keep, and what to do if
   summarising fails — lives there.

                # question ("did they send /stop?") is False, so the line would
