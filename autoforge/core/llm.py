"""LLM clients.

`LLMClient` is a one-method protocol so swapping providers never touches the
agent loop. Two implementations ship in-tree:

* `OpenAICompatClient` — any `/chat/completions` endpoint (OpenAI, DeepSeek,
  Moonshot, DashScope, aiping, vLLM, Ollama, a local gateway...).
* `MockLLMClient` — scripted or callback-driven, used by tests and by the
  demo so the framework is provably runnable with zero API keys.

    The problem this exists for is not hypothetical and not fixable at the
    provider: a gateway that answers 200 six times in a row can answer 503 for
    three minutes, and a forge round is the unit of budget -- one blip inside it
    costs the whole tool, whatever the retry ladder underneath does. Retrying
    rides out a short burst; it cannot ride out an outage. A second endpoint can.

    Three decisions worth their reasons:

    *Health is remembered, not recomputed.* An endpoint that failed is skipped
      for `cooldown` seconds instead of being tried first again, so a down
      primary costs one timeout per cooldown rather than one per call. The
      arithmetic is the argument: at three minutes per failed attempt, trying
      the dead endpoint first on every call is the outage.

    *The order is sticky, not round-robin.* Whoever answered last is tried
      first, so a working endpoint stays in use and the prompt prefix stays on
      one provider -- which is what prompt caching needs. Round-robin would
      spread the same conversation across providers and pay full price for the
      prefix every time.

    *`LLMAborted` is never a reason to fail over.* The operator asking to stop
      is a decision, not an outage; re-asking the same question on another
      endpoint is exactly what `should_abort` exists to prevent.

    The failure is reported as one error listing every endpoint and what it
    said, because "all of them are down" and "the one you configured is wrong"
    need different fixes and a bare exception cannot tell them apart.
