"""What CPU silicon and toolchain is actually here.

`probe()` never raises. `available=False` is a first-class answer, not an error,
for the same reason the GPU layer does it: this code has to run on a laptop with
no compiler and on a rented box with three of them.

`available` on this side means something slightly different from the GPU side,
and the difference is worth stating. A GPU probe asks "is there hardware?"
Here it asks "can I build?" — because on a CPU the hardware is never in doubt
(you are running on it) and the thing that is actually missing is the compiler.
So `available` is a statement about the toolchain, and `notes` says which half
was found.

The feature list is read out of the compiler rather than out of the operating
system. That is deliberate: what matters to a kernel forge is not what the CPU
can do, it is what the toolchain will *emit* for it, and those are different
questions. `gcc -march=native -dM -E` answers the second one, and it is the same
answer the build will get. A /proc/cpuinfo flag list answers the first and can
disagree.

The two hazards this module exists to surface:

  CACHE. A CPU kernel that tiles for the wrong cache size is slower than a naive
  one, and the kernel author cannot see the size from inside the kernel. Reporting
  L1/L2/L3 here is what makes the tiling decision derivable instead of guessed.

  `-march=native`. The CPU analogue of building a cubin for the wrong SM, except
  worse: a cubin for a newer SM fails to load, while a native binary for a newer
  CPU *loads and then dies with SIGILL* on an older one. `native` is recorded as
  the target it actually resolved to, and `runs_here()` refuses an artefact built
  wider than this machine.
