"""Not letting a kernel take the process down with it.

This is the layer the GPU side does not need and the CPU side cannot do
without, and the reason is structural. A bad CUDA kernel fails at a driver call
that returns an error code. A bad C kernel does one of three things the agent
cannot survive:

  IT SEGFAULTS. A missing bounds check writes past the end of a buffer and the
  interpreter dies with the agent's whole session in it. No exception is raised,
  no finally block runs, nothing is logged.

  IT NEVER RETURNS. `while (i <= n)` with an off-by-one instead of `<` is an
  infinite loop over a buffer, and in-process there is no way to interrupt it
  that does not also kill the agent.

  IT CORRUPTS THE HEAP. The failure surfaces somewhere unrelated, minutes later,
  in code that is not the kernel.

So a kernel is never called in the agent's process until it has been called in
somebody else's. `run_isolated` is that somebody: a fresh `python -m` child with
a hard timeout, whose death — by signal, by exit code, by timeout — is reported
as data. The parent then decides whether to try again, and never dies of it.

`preflight` is the cheap half: a source scan that catches the handful of things
worth knowing before spending a compile on them. It is a lint, not a sandbox,
and it says so — the isolation is what makes running an unchecked kernel
survivable, and preflight is what makes reading the result less surprising.
