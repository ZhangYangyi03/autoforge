"""The claim gate: a sixth check, and the first one that is about a *claim*.

A-E ask "does this tool run, survive, resist attack, fire when needed, and stay
quiet when not". None of them asks the question that actually costs a week:

    is the number this tool hands back a fact about the world, or is it a fact
    about the data it happened to be handed?

That question has a name in the experimental sciences -- it is what a control
is for -- and it has been answered the same way since long before software:
    (1) do the same thing twice and get the same answer,
    (2) do it to the same thing in a different order and get the same answer,
    (3) feed it a case whose right answer you already know and check that it
        says so.

This module runs those three against a freshly forged tool, using nothing but
the tool's own declared inputs. It reads the tool's parameter schema for a
*rail*: a parameter with two or more declared values that the tool is supposed
to be sensitive to (an enum, or a boolean flag). A tool with no rail is not
audited here -- and says so, rather than passing quietly.

Two shapes are recognised, because they fail in opposite directions:

  predict  f(rail=A) and f(rail=B) must differ (it must be reading its own
           input), and must each be (1) reproducible and (2) order-invariant.

  audit    the tool judges *someone else's* claim (it takes a target column and
           a prediction column). Here the rail is the control: permute the
           target column and the verdict MUST collapse. An auditor that still
           says PASS after its labels have been shuffled is not measuring
           anything, and it says PASS just as confidently on the case it was
           built to catch.

That second shape is not hypothetical. It is the exact failure this module was
written after: `audit_predictive_claim_csv`, forged on 2026-10-02, returned
VERDICT: PASS on a dataset whose prediction column was partly derived from the
label. Nine checks went green and the tool was wrong in the one way it existed
to prevent. The battery asked whether the code ran; nothing asked whether the
judgement was real.

Scope, stated so it is not overread: this is a *behavioural* gate. It runs the
tool and perturbs its inputs. It does not read the code, and a tool that
hard-codes its answers to survive exactly these perturbations would pass. That
is a real limit, and it is the same limit every test suite has.
