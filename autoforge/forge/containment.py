"""OS-level containment for forged code — the runner `Sandbox` promises.

`forge/sandbox.py` states the gap in its own docstring: process + timeout +
environment scrubbing bounds *blast radius*, and it says outright that a real
sandbox needs OS-level containment, with `runner` as the hook. This module is
that hook, filled in.

Windows: a Job Object. The child is assigned the moment it exists, before it
has run a line, and the job carries

  * JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_PROCESS_MEMORY / _JOB_MEMORY -- a run that asks for a
    600 MB bytearray under a 256 MB cap gets a catchable `MemoryError`, not a
    machine that swaps itself to death.
  * JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_ACTIVE_PROCESS -- a forged tool that forks is refused by
    the kernel, not killed after the fact by a counting loop in Python.
  * JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_JOB_TIME -- CPU seconds, enforced whether or not the
    parent's poll loop is still healthy.
  * JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE -- the interesting one. A tool that
    spawns a detached grandchild and returns cannot outlive the run: when the
    last handle to the job closes, everything in it dies. `proc.kill()` reaches
    the direct child only; this reaches the tree, including the processes
    detached on purpose to survive it.

POSIX: `resource.setrlimit` in a preexec_fn -- address space, CPU seconds,
file size, open files, and RLIMIT_NPROC where the kernel honours it.

What this still does NOT claim: it is containment, not a security boundary
against an adversary who already has code execution as this user. There is no
seccomp filter here and no filesystem namespace -- a contained run can still
read the files this user can read. That layer is the Linux one, and it is
described in DESIGN.md rather than written here, because code I cannot test on
this host is a claim, not a capability.
