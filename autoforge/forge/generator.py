"""Code generation for new tools.

Two generators, one interface:

* `LLMToolGenerator` — asks a model for a single self-contained Python
  function plus its schema and trigger probes. The model is told to emit a
  *strict JSON envelope*, and we parse defensively: models wrap JSON in
  prose, fences, or trailing commentary often enough that a strict
  `json.loads` is a bug, not a test. The envelope itself also arrives
  near-miss — unescaped quotes inside the `code` field, trailing commas, and
  (the defect that broke the first live runs on *both* aiping and a local
  qwen2.5:7b) a stray `}` that closes the object after `code` while the model
  then keeps writing `entry`/`parameters`/`probes`. See `_repair_variants`.

* `TemplateGenerator` — deterministic, offline, no API key. Used by the demo
  and by tests to prove the pipeline end-to-end without network.

Design note: the generator proposes, it does not decide. Nothing generated
here is trusted — the pipeline is what grants state.

GENERATOR_SYSTEM = """You are a tool smith inside an agent framework.

You write ONE self-contained Python function that solves a recurring subtask,
plus the metadata that lets the framework verify it.

  "description": "one sentence, imperative: what it does and when to use it",
  "code": "def tool_name(...):\\n    ...",
  "entry": "tool_name",
  "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {...}, "required": [...]},
  "probes": [
    {"query": "a user request that SHOULD trigger this tool",
     "expect": "call",
     "negative_query": "a request that should NOT trigger it"}
  ],
  "sample_call": {"argument_name": "a REAL, valid value this tool is meant to handle"},
  "sample_expect": "a substring that a correct answer to sample_call must contain",
  "effect_signature": "pure | reads:<what> | writes:<what>",
  "tags": ["category"],
  "rationale": "why this tool is worth creating"
}

Rules:
- The function must be pure Python stdlib unless the description says otherwise.
- No imports outside the standard library. No file writes unless effect_signature says so.
- SAMPLE_CALL IS MANDATORY AND IT IS THE EXAM. Give one concrete, real,
  valid input -- the kind of value this tool exists to handle -- and the
  substring a correct answer must contain. The verifier runs it FIRST and
  rejects the tool if it answers "INVALID:", returns nothing, or does not
  contain sample_expect. Do not pick a value your tool would reject to look
  safe: a valid example that returns INVALID is an automatic failure, and an
  empty or absent sample_call means the tool is recorded as UNPROBED, which is
  worse than a failed probe. For a network tool the example is a real URL and
  a real query; for a parser, a real well-formed string; for arithmetic, real
  numbers and the expected result. If you cannot state a valid input and its
  answer, you do not yet understand the tool well enough to write it.
- TOTALITY — the verifier enforces this and rejects the tool if you break it:
  never raise, and never return None. On input you cannot process, return a
  short string starting "INVALID:" with the reason, e.g.
  "INVALID: not a 10- or 13-digit ISBN". On success return the result itself.
  The verifier fuzzes every parameter with empty strings, whitespace, very long
  strings, emoji, digits-only, and None-ish tokens ("NULL", "None", "nan"). Any
  raise fails the tool, so guard every parse and index with a length or
  validity check first.
- Being total is necessary, NOT sufficient. "Returns INVALID for everything"
  satisfies totality and fails sample_call, which is the point: the tool is
  judged on the real input it was written for, not on its handling of junk.
- The invalid result must DIFFER from any valid result, so a wrong-but-total
  function that returns one constant everywhere is also rejected.
- Be whitespace-insensitive where whitespace is not content: strip surrounding
  whitespace before parsing, so "  x  " and "x" behave identically.
- LABELS ARE DECORATION. If the argument is a labelled identifier, a leading
  label is noise, not value: "x", "ISBN x", "ISBN: x", "ISBN-13: x" and the URL
  form must all normalise identically. Strip any such label before parsing. The
  verifier checks exactly this and rejects a tool that only handles the form you
  happened to think of.
- Raise ValueError belongs nowhere; return "INVALID: ..." instead.
- SELF-CONTAINED means every name your entry function calls must be defined in
  the same `code` string. Never call a helper you did not write out — inline it
  into the entry function instead. An undefined name is an execution failure.
- Be terse. No docstrings, no comments, no validation beyond what totality
  needs. Short code is less likely to be cut off mid-JSON.
- Include 2-4 probes. At least one probe must have a negative_query that is
  superficially related but must NOT trigger this tool (guards over-triggering).
- Keep `code` under 40 lines.
