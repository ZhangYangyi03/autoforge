"""Behaviour-aligned tool routing.

Mainstream skill libraries retrieve by *text similarity*: embed the need,
embed each skill description, take the nearest. This routinely surfaces a
skill that reads right and runs wrong, because semantic closeness is not
execution success.

The fix (credited to Memento-Skills, generalised here) is to score candidates
on *observed behaviour*:
    score = w_text * text_similarity
          + w_success * success_rate
          + w_trust * state_trust
          - w_cost * cost_penalty
          - w_fire * over_trigger_penalty

No offline RL required — a weighted, inspectable blend. The weights are the
policy, and they live in one dataclass so the agent's retrieval taste is a
tunable, debuggable thing rather than an opaque vector index.

    """The retrieval taste, as numbers that were measured rather than chosen.

    These shipped as 1.0 / 1.2 / 0.8 / 0.5 / 0.6, picked by taste and never
    scored. `tools/calibrate_routing.py` scores them against two ground-truth
    sets that were already on disk:

      probes  312 (query, expect=call) pairs from the tools' own TriggerProbes,
              plus 312 (negative_query) pairs they must NOT win. Model-written
              from the description, so lexical access is easy. Necessary, not
              sufficient.
      forged  117 accepted forges: real needs, written with no knowledge of what
              the tool would one day be called, against the library as it stood
              at that moment. The only set that is not partly the router's echo.

    The old numbers were not slightly wrong, they were the wrong shape. `success`
    and `trust` do not depend on the query -- they are per-tool constants -- so
    as additive terms they are a fixed bonus on every query, and the more weight
    they carry the more they drown out the only term that answers "which tool for
    THIS need". Raising them to catch a flaky tool also promotes it for needs it
    has nothing to do with.

        5-fold CV, 114 forged cases                top1    recall@5
          shipped 1.0 / 1.2 / 0.8 / 0.5 / 0.6      0.183     0.228

          text + availability gate + trust tiebreak 0.570    0.833

    So the two questions are separated, because they are different questions:

    *Relevance* is `text * gate`. The gate is `min(1, success_rate / gate)` --
      a proven-broken tool is scaled toward zero, and a healthy one is scaled by
      exactly 1.0. It never rewards. A tool with too few calls to judge keeps
      its default 0.5, which is exactly the threshold, so it is not penalised
      for being new. On the real corpus this fires on 1 of 120 tools (22 of the
      24 judged tools are at success 1.0), so it costs nothing measurable and
      stops a never-working tool from outranking a working one on the strength
      of its name.

    *Trust* is a weak tiebreak (`trust`, default 0.1). It is small on purpose:
      it orders two candidates that match the need equally well -- a probed
      tool ahead of a probationary one -- and is too small to reorder candidates
      that differ in relevance.

    `cost` and `over_trigger` default to 0 because they are 0.0 for all 120
    tools: `cost_hint` is "cheap" everywhere and `trigger_misses` is unpopulated.
    A term that cannot vary is not evidence, and leaving it non-zero is how the
    old numbers went wrong. They stay tunable for when the ledger fills in.

    `amend_self(routing_weights=...)` still edits all of these.

    `loads` — how many times the agent actually opened the skill — so a
    procedure that keeps getting reached for climbs above one that merely reads
    well. That is the failure this repo exists to argue against: nearest-
    description retrieval returns the skill that reads right and runs wrong.

    Two of the tool router's four terms are deliberately absent. A skill has no
    state lifecycle to score trust from and no cost hint, so including them
    would mean inventing numbers and calling the result a measurement. Where
    the tool router says "not measured yet" (0.5 for too-few calls), the skill
