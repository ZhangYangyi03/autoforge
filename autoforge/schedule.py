"""Scheduling: work that outlives the conversation that asked for it.

The hard part here is not storing a timestamp. It is not lying about what a
schedule can do, because the obvious implementation lies in a way that is easy
to miss:

    A scheduler inside a process can only fire while that process is running.

An agent that accepts "remind me tomorrow at nine" and stores a row it will
never look at has taken an instruction it cannot keep, and the human on the
other end will believe it. So this module draws the line explicitly, and the
tools built on it say which side they are on:

  * `Schedule` is a durable task table. It does nothing on its own. `due()` is
    a *query*: "what is overdue as of now". The agent calls it when it runs.
  * `tick` is that call. Whatever the agent decides to do with the overdue
    tasks is the agent's business, but nothing fires behind its back.
  * `install_system_task` is how the process gets to run at all when no human
    is present — it hands the problem to the operating system (Task Scheduler
    on Windows, cron elsewhere), which genuinely can start a process no one
    asked for. It is a separate, explicit, privileged act, and it prints what
    it registered rather than doing it quietly.

The distinction between the first two and the third is the whole point. A
`Schedule` row is a promise the agent can keep only while it is alive; a system
task is what makes it alive. Conflating them is how an "autonomous" agent ends
up being a to-do list nobody reads.

Missed runs are reported as missed, not skipped. If a task was due at 03:00 and
the agent next runs at 11:00, `due()` says so and by how much: silently
advancing the schedule would erase the evidence that the agent was not running,
which is exactly the fact worth knowing.
