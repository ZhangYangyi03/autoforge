"""Skills: procedural knowledge the agent keeps as files and finds by use.

Tools answer "what can be done here". Skills answer "how this is done here" —
the sequence, the pitfalls, the thing that went wrong last time. The agent had
plenty of the first and none of the second, which is why it re-derived the same
approach every session and could not tell a procedure it had run forty times
from one it had never tried.

Two decisions shape everything below.

*The files own the content.* A skill is markdown with a frontmatter header, on
disk, in a directory a human can open and edit. No part of a skill's text lives
only in the database, so a skill outlives the agent that wrote it.

*The database owns the history.* `loads` counts how often the agent actually
opened a skill. That counter is what makes retrieval behavioural rather than
lexical: a procedure that keeps getting reached for outranks one that merely
reads as relevant. The counter is written by the act of loading, so it cannot
drift away from what happened.

Progressive disclosure: the prompt carries a menu — name, when-to-use, load
count — and never the bodies. A library of forty skills costs forty lines, and
the agent pays for a body only when it decides to read one. That decision is
the retrieval event, which is why the menu is not a summary of the library but
the index of it.

        own menu was cut will conclude it has no procedure for a task it does
        have one for, which is the failure this whole module exists to fix.

        Three things the first version got wrong, all of them costing prompt
        space every turn:

        *The header was not counted.* `budget` was spent on entries while the
        header line rode free, so the menu was always over its own cap.

        *`if shown and ...` guaranteed at least one entry.* With many short
        lines the budget never bound at all — nineteen skills rendered in full
        under a 1400-character cap. The floor is now a floor on *reporting*,
        not on listing: if nothing fits, the menu says so instead of silently
        blowing the budget.

        *Never-loaded skills were listed at full width.* They are the majority
        of any library that has been written to more than it has been read
        from, and they are the weakest bets in it, so they get the shorter
        lines and a cap: past MENU_COLD_MAX_LISTED the remainder fold into the
        count line. Nothing is lost -- the files are on disk, `skill_list` reads
        them all, and `skill_view` still opens any of them by name -- and what
        is dropped is the per-turn cost of advertising procedures that have
        never once been reached for. That cap then over-reached: written as
        `if len(cold) <= MENU_COLD_MAX_LISTED`, it hid *every* cold skill in
        any library larger than the cap, so forty never-loaded skills rendered
        as no names at all. A cap on how much prompt the unread part of a
        library earns is not a licence to make it invisible -- the count line
        has to be there either way.

    Why this exists at all: the borrowed part of Intelligence Indeed that is
    actually worth having is not its harness (an AWS VM, an OSWorld grader, an
    Anthropic key) -- it is nine hand-written procedures about driving desktop
    applications, which took somebody real effort to learn and which cost
    nothing to keep. They are in the tree under ``vendor/tars`` as a verbatim
    copy; this function is what makes them *mine* rather than a checkout
    sitting next to me.

    Three decisions, each with a reason:

    *Flat, in the user's own skills directory, under a ``tars-`` prefix.* The
      prefix is not cosmetic: it is how a reader of the menu can tell a
      procedure that arrived from a stranger from one this agent learned here.
      Flat rather than a subdirectory because ``SkillLibrary.scan`` finds flat
      files and ``<category>/<name>/SKILL.md`` packages, and inventing a third
      layout to hold borrowed files would be a scanner bug waiting to happen.
    *The body is copied unchanged, behind one provenance line.* The prefix line
      is the licence and the source, in the file itself, so a copy that got
      separated from ``ORIGIN.txt`` still says where it came from. Editing the
      body would be "improving" a procedure whose whole value is that somebody
      else ran it -- and this agent has not run it once.
    *Idempotent, and it does not reset usage.* Re-running rewrites the text and
      leaves ``loads`` alone (``SkillLibrary.write`` carries the counter over),
      so a re-port cannot be mistaken for a fresh, unproven procedure.

    Returns a small report so the caller can see what happened rather than
    trusting that it did.
