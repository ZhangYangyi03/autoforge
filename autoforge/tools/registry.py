"""The tool registry: hot-swappable, self-policing, observable.

Three properties the framework needs that a plain dict of functions lacks:

1. **Hot swap** — tools can be added/removed while the agent runs. The
   registry owns the schema list handed to the LLM, so a newly forged tool is
   usable on the very next turn.
2. **Policing** — every call is recorded in the spec's ledger. A tool that
   degrades below threshold is auto-quarantined; a quarantined tool is hidden
   from context but still executable via `force=True`.
3. **Observability** — `report()` gives a full picture of tool health, which
   is what makes "did my agent get better or worse" an answerable question.
